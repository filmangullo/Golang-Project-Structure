#### Binary Distributions

Official binary distributions are available at https://go.dev/dl/.

After downloading a binary release, visit https://go.dev/doc/install
for installation instructions.

#### Install From Source

If a binary distribution is not available for your combination of
operating system and architecture, visit
https://go.dev/doc/install/source
for source installation instructions.

### Run

After installing "air" you don't need to run "$ go run ." but just "$ air"

For less typing, you could add `alias air='~/.air'` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

First enter into your project

```bash
cd /path/to/your_project
```

The simplest usage is run

```bash
# firstly find `.air.toml` in current directory, if not found, use defaults
air -c .air.toml
```

You can initialize the `.air.toml` configuration file to the current directory with the default settings running the following command.

```bash
air init
```

After this, you can just run the `air` command without additional arguments and it will use the `.air.toml` file for configuration.

```bash
air
```

For modifying the configuration refer to the [air_example.toml](air_example.toml) file.
